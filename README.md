## **Description**
GraphQL Server Deep Dive dives into the basic parts of a GraphQL server implementation. It provides examples of a few tools and conventions that are important for teams to be aware of when building complex GraphQL APIs.

#### **The Building Blocks of a GraphQL API**
  - **Schema** - A type system defined for your data. This acts as a contract for a type system defined for your data. This represents a contract of what information is exposed to the API consumer.
  - **Resolvers** - A set of functions defined for each type. These functions are called when types are requested and validated against the schema.

#### **Managing Complex Schemas**
1. A dive into SDL-first and Code-first development.
  - SDL-first example
  - Code-first example with GraphQL Nexus

2. A quick look at how to manage a microservice or service oriented architecture
  - Schema Stitching
  - Apollo Federation example
 
#### **Execution**
Provided by the folks at Thoughtbot, this diagram explains the lifecycle of a GraphQL request and server response.

## Getting started

1. Change `index.ts` file to point at your preferred schema object.  Comment out other schema imports or comment out `apolloServer` and uncomment `gateway` to explore [Schema Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/federation/federation-spec/)

2. Run `yarn && yarn start` in root

3. Go to http://localhost:4000 to query Playground
